## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities


Bobin Chen -  Backend + Unit Testing
Bobin will be involved in the writing of unit tests ensuring our work is correct before it can be committed. This will help reduce issues before our changes make it to master and will prevent the client from receiving apps that do not work.
Strengths: Java (Backend), MySQL, Javascript
Weaknesses: CSS, Agile methodology, Git

Kevin Hu - Full Stack + Localization 
Kevin will take on localization of the app as, int the future, it will need to be adapted for many different languages and countries. He will ensure that other regions and languages can be easily added without changing the actual code. He is also the primary contact to My Oral Village and will communicate between the two parties.
Strengths: Android (Full Stack), MySQL, Design
Weaknesses: Testing

Manu Cherthedath - Backend + Deployment
Manu is responsible for the design and implementation of the backend, in particular the database which will store the transactions, as well as managing the server the backend server will be deployed on. He will also write scripts that will allow for the app to be deployed by the client. 
Strengths: MySQL, MongoDB, Flask, Java (Backend), Server Management
Weaknesses: GUI, Understanding what is user friendly for the average human.

Matthew Tory - Front End + Implementation
Matthew will be taking involved in the visual design process of the app. He will be taking some of the mockups and designs from the client and implementing them into our app.
Strengths: Android, Flutter (Cross Platform), Graphic Design
Weaknesses: Databases

Rachel Yan - Front End + Testing
Rachel will be very involved in the UI testing of the app. She will ensure that the the UI matches what it is supposed to do. She will create tasks that users may perform and ensure that they work as intended.
Strengths: Java, Python, C, C#
Weaknesses: Everything else stemming from a lack of meaningful experience

Shervin K - Full Stack + UX
Shervin will be involved in the process of taking our backend APIs and connecting them to the front end. He will also focus on the usability of our app ensuring all users can have a good experience.
Strengths: Java (Full Stack), Android, MySQL, GUI, UX
Weaknesses: Testing and documentation

Simon Berest - Front End + Research
Simon will be involved in researching different design philosophies to determine what will work best for our users. Using this research he will implement changes that will help reduce the learning curve for new users.
Strengths: Java, Python, C
Weaknesses: Everything else stemming from a lack of meaningful experience


#### Team Rules

Our teams culture is mature and flexible. One of the first things that we discussed in class was how to handle a variety of problems. The overwhelming solution to the wide range of those problems was to talk about it like a mature adult. There is no point in spite. If you are angry it is important to understand why and communicate the reason. Similarly we are flexible. Many of the team members have experience working in the field or with clients. As such those without this experience will use this opportunity to develop these skills and support the team. Additionally there is not one glaring weakness. We have at least two people working on the front end and two people working on the back end.

Early on our team decided to use Slack as our primary communication method. We have everyoneâ€™s email and phone number in case of emergencies or Slack failure. We decided to have a maximum of twelve hours to respond on weekdays and twenty-four hours over the weekend. We all attend the same weekly lecture and tutorial as well.

At the moment we are using Google Meet to conduct meetings with the team at My Oral Village. In addition they want us to use their git repository and have invited us to their Slack workplace. At the moment this is still under discussion. Face to face meetings are being organized, the current pln is either one a week or one every two weeks.

Group members are held accountable through the shocking method of maturity. There is no three-strike-system. THere is no punishment that a group member can hand out. If a deadline is missed our first step is to figure out why. If needed, work can be redistributed. If the group as a whole feels like someone is not meeting their deadlines they can be put on notice. If they continue to fail to meet expectations that is when a professor or teaching assistant should be called in.

  The first problem we discussed in class is that a team member is not meeting their deadlines. The single person solution is to ask why. As a group the workload can be redistributed. Additionally the deadlines can be made more granular so that the group member can provide some finished products.
  The second problem we discussed is when one person makes decisions on behalf of everyone without much consultation. Here the solution depends on the outcome. If their design choices end up being good then it is worth keeping the design despite any negativity people may feel. Still, a discussion must be had on why they decided to work by themselves. If the design choices are bad then we can ask why they chose to go that route. Even bad design choices have redeeming qualities.
  The third problem would be if someone disappeared, if they completely cut contact and do not come to class. Our first order of business would be to try and talk with their friends. If they are completely gone the only recourse is talk with a professor to make sure they did not drop the class without informing us. In the end even if they are not kicked out of the group they still are not getting marks for it so in essence it does not matter.



#### Events
We have two meetings each week, this includes a internal meeting inside our group and a external meeting with our partner. We will set a recurring meeting to ensure our working progress. We chose doing in-person meetings rather than online meetings as we feel they are better for communication.

Our internal group meetings will be scheduled on Tuesday, inside University of Toronto. This meeting is a combined session of coding and coding review. We will first check the progress of all our groupmates to ensure the tasks can be finished on time and rearrange the tasks if necessary. After that, we will review all our existing code and correct it if necessary. If time is available, we will code together after reviewing.

We plan to have meeting once a week or every other week through face to face communication inside University of Toronto with our partner. The meeting is tentatively scheduled for Friday. In the meeting, we will present the current work to our partner and make amendments using the feedback from them. This meeting can be used to improve our work and make sure the functionality of our product fit the expectations of our partner.


#### Artifacts 
 
 * We will employ Trello to keep track of what needs to be done. We will divide our project into small tasks that can be completed independently of each other. Tasks will then be split amongst group members as a group function. Smaller one of tasks can be completed by anyone but larger tasks will be informally decided by the group. For example, we decided that Manu is going to be doing the Main work for the back end. We just do not know exactly what that work is yet.
 * Tasks can be in one of four states.
   * **Upcoming** meaning the task has been created, but not yet started by any group member
   * **In Progress** meaning some group member is actively working on completing the task
   * **Testing** meaning the product of the task is being tested or refined
   * **Completed** meaning the task has been completed
 * To ensure that tasks are being completed actively and efficiently, we will set task deadlines. This means that the group member assigned to a task must mark it **Completed** by the set deadline.
 * During our work, we may find that new tasks need to be created, or tasks need to be redistributed among group members. Generally speaking, we will strive to divide tasks evenly amongst group members, however this depends on the complexity of each task, availability of each member, and our individual skill sets.


#### Goals and tasks
The goal of this iteration is building a money transaction system between users largely using graphics designed by My Oral Village Inc. This system will take the form of an android app. The app will largely be used by innumerate people and those who want or need to exchange money with them.

We have four main tasks listed in order of priority.
The first task is to build a system to send and receive money from different users.
This is the backbone of what any money transaction system needs.
The second task is to build a qr code system to send and receive money.
This is for merchants who can use the same qr code for the same function
For example multiple people buying an apple can use the same qr code
The third task is to display the transaction history.
        This must be done in an intuitive way that does not rely on a users knowledge
The fourth task is an address book.
This must be done largely using visuals. 
    


#### Artifacts 

List/describe the artifacts you will produce in order to present your project idea.

*We will first come up with a wireframe of our app on a prototyping software such as Adobe XD. This will be used to quickly give an idea of how our product will look and function, as well as allow us to quickly alter, add, or remove features.

*Next, from that we will build up the front end portion of our app with a mock database in order to demonstrate how our app will work with data.

*Finally, we will deliver an Android app in the form of an APK. Since our clients are requesting a demo, we will not be deploying the app and it will be up to their discretion to choose how the app will be displayed.
