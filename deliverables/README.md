* This app is a demo so that My Oral Village Inc to showcase their innumerate-enabling designs.
 * Millions of people around the world are financially illiterate, and as the world moves towards technological financial solutions, these individuals are being left behind. This app enables financially illiterate (or semi-illiterate) users to manage their finances in an easy-to-understand environment.
 * Given that our target users are financially illiterate, it is important to have a solution that supports this disability.

For example, when sending money, instead of the user having to input numbers (which they might not understand), they input an amount in terms of bills and coins.
