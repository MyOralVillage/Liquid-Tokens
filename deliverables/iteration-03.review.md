## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: 16:00 EDT 2019-03-31
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection



#### Decisions that turned out well

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.

* Using standard Github routine
    * When adding new functionalities and making changes each team member created their own branch, committed their changes to that branch, and submitted a pull request. This was a crucial decision to avoid conflicts and problems during implementation.
* Using Trello to organize tasklist
    * This allowed us to list out all of the tasks that need to be done. Team members were able to choose tasks to work on while making sure others did not work on the same thing.
* Using Slack for communication
    * This allowed us to talk about ideas, and share snippets of code with the entire group without any issue. 


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.

* Deciding to meet with MOV (the client) weekly.

    * This took up time each week and added logistical complexity that we had to deal with, we do not think that the app was improved much as a result of these weekly meetings, something like bi weekly would have been better.
* Not assigning specific tasks to specific people, and setting internal deadlines.
    * At times there was confusion regarding who was doing what, and what different people should be working on.
